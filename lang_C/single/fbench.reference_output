Ready to begin John Walker's floating point accuracy
and performance benchmark.  1000 iterations will be made.


Measured run time in seconds should be divided by 1
to normalise for reporting results.  For archival results,
adjust iteration count so the benchmark runs about five minutes.

Stop the timer:
No errors in results.
